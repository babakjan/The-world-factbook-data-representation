                     <h3>Background</h3>
                     <p><strong></strong> France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among
                        European nations. It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the
                        United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral
                        organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009,
                        reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO. Since 1958,
                        it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant
                        to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations.
                        In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central
                        to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency,
                        the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities
                        - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions
                        and were made part of France proper.<br></p>

                     <h3>Economic overview</h3>
                     <p><strong></strong> The French economy is diversified across all sectors. The government has partially
                        or fully privatized many large companies, including Air France, France Telecom, Renault,
                        and Thales. However, the government maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly
                        power, public transport, and defense industries. France is the most visited country
                        in the world with 89 million foreign tourists in 2017. France's leaders remain committed
                        to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies,
                        and social spending that mitigate economic inequality.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> France's real GDP grew by 1.9% in 2017, up from 1.2% the year before. The unemployment
                        rate (including overseas territories) increased from 7.8% in 2008 to 10.2% in 2015,
                        before falling to 9.0% in 2017. Youth unemployment in metropolitan France decreased
                        from 24.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 20.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> France’s public finances have historically been strained by high spending and low
                        growth. In 2017, the budget deficit improved to 2.7% of GDP, bringing it in compliance
                        with the EU-mandated 3% deficit target. Meanwhile, France's public debt rose from
                        89.5% of GDP in 2012 to 97% in 2017.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> Since entering office in May 2017, President Emmanuel MACRON launched a series of
                        economic reforms to improve competitiveness and boost economic growth. President MACRON
                        campaigned on reforming France’s labor code and in late 2017 implemented a range of
                        reforms to increase flexibility in the labor market by making it easier for firms
                        to hire and fire and simplifying negotiations between employers and employees. In
                        addition to labor reforms, President MACRON’s 2018 budget cuts public spending, taxes,
                        and social security contributions to spur private investment and increase purchasing
                        power. The government plans to gradually reduce corporate tax rate for businesses
                        from 33.3% to 25% by 2022.<br></p>
