                     <h3>Background</h3>
                     <p><strong></strong> As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia), Germany
                        is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense organizations.
                        European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating world wars in the first
                        half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers
                        of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War,
                        two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
                        and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself
                        in key western economic and security organizations, the EC (now the EU) and NATO,
                        while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline
                        of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German reunification in 1990.
                        Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity
                        and wages up to western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other EU countries
                        introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro.<br></p>

                        														note: adopted 1922; the anthem, also known as
                        														"Deutschlandlied" (Song of Germany), was originally adopted for
                        														its connection to the March 1848 liberal revolution; following
                        														appropriation by the Nazis of the first verse, specifically the
                        														phrase, "Deutschland, Deutschland ueber alles" (Germany, Germany
                        														above all) to promote nationalism, it was banned after 1945; in
                        														1952, its third verse was adopted by West Germany as its
                        														national anthem; in 1990, it became the national anthem for the
                        														reunited Germany<br></p>

                  <section class="subsection">
                     <h3>Economic overview</h3>
                     <p><strong></strong> The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world in PPP terms and Europe's
                        largest - is a leading exporter of machinery, vehicles, chemicals, and household equipment.
                        Germany benefits from a highly skilled labor force, but, like its Western European
                        neighbors, faces significant demographic challenges to sustained long-term growth.
                        Low fertility rates and a large increase in net immigration are increasing pressure
                        on the country's social welfare system and necessitate structural reforms.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> Reforms launched by the government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed
                        necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average growth, contributed
                        to strong economic growth and falling unemployment. These advances, as well as a government
                        subsidized, reduced working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase
                        in unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World War II. The
                        German Government introduced a minimum wage in 2015 that increased to $9.79 (8.84
                        euros) in January 2017.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and 2009 and tax cuts introduced
                        in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second term increased Germany's total budget deficit
                        - including federal, state, and municipal - to 4.1% in 2010, but slower spending and
                        higher tax revenues reduced the deficit to 0.8% in 2011 and in 2017 Germany reached
                        a budget surplus of 0.7%. A constitutional amendment approved in 2009 limits the federal
                        government to structural deficits of no more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016,
                        though the target was already reached in 2012.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Chancellor Angela MERKEL announced
                        in May 2011 that eight of the country's 17 nuclear reactors would be shut down immediately
                        and the remaining plants would close by 2022. Germany plans to replace nuclear power
                        largely with renewable energy, which accounted for 29.5% of gross electricity consumption
                        in 2016, up from 9% in 2000. Before the shutdown of the eight reactors, Germany relied
                        on nuclear power for 23% of its electricity generating capacity and 46% of its base-load
                        electricity production.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> The German economy suffers from low levels of investment, and a government plan to
                        invest 15 billion euros during 2016-18, largely in infrastructure, is intended to
                        spur needed private investment. Domestic consumption, investment, and exports are
                        likely to drive German GDP growth in 2018, and the country’s budget and trade surpluses
                        are likely to remain high.<br></p>
