                     <h3>Background</h3>
                     <p><strong></strong> The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary
                        democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century,
                        the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half
                        of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and
                        the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling
                        of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation.
                        As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member
                        of NATO and the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy.
                        The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland
                        Assembly were established in 1998.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> The UK has been an active member of the EU since its accession in 1973, although it
                        chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. However, motivated in part
                        by frustration at a remote bureaucracy in Brussels and massive migration into the
                        country, UK citizens on 23 June 2016 narrowly voted to leave the EU. The UK is scheduled
                        to depart the EU on 31 January 2020, but negotiations on the future EU-UK economic
                        and security relationship will continue throughout 2020 and potentially beyond.<br></p>

                  <section class="subsection">
                     <h3>Economic overview</h3>
                     <p><strong></strong> The UK, a leading trading power and financial center, is the third largest economy
                        in Europe after Germany and France. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and
                        efficient by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with less than
                        2% of the labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil resources, but
                        its oil and natural gas reserves are declining; the UK has been a net importer of
                        energy since 2005. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business services,
                        are key drivers of British GDP growth. Manufacturing, meanwhile, has declined in importance
                        but still accounts for about 10% of economic output.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> In 2008, the global financial crisis hit the economy particularly hard, due to the
                        importance of its financial sector. Falling home prices, high consumer debt, and the
                        global economic slowdown compounded the UKs economic problems, pushing the economy
                        into recession in the latter half of 2008 and prompting the then BROWN (Labour) government
                        to implement a number of measures to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial
                        markets. Facing burgeoning public deficits and debt levels, in 2010 the then CAMERON-led
                        coalition government (between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats) initiated an austerity
                        program, which has continued under the Conservative government. However, the deficit
                        still remains one of the highest in the G7, standing at 3.6% of GDP as of 2017, and
                        the UK has pledged to lower its corporation tax from 20% to 17% by 2020. The UK had
                        a debt burden of 90.4% GDP at the end of 2017.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> The UK economy has begun to slow since the referendum vote to leave the EU in June
                        2016. A sustained depreciation of the British pound has increased consumer and producer
                        prices, weighing on consumer spending without spurring a meaningful increase in exports.
                        The UK has an extensive trade relationship with other EU members through its single
                        market membership, and economic observers have warned the exit will jeopardize its
                        position as the central location for European financial services. The UK is slated
                        to leave the EU at the end of January 2020.<br></p>

                        sovereignty" arrangement between the UK and Spain; the Government of Gibraltar insisted
                        on equal participation in talks between the two countries; Spain disapproved of UK
                        plans to grant Gibraltar greater autonomy; Mauritius and Seychelles claim the Chagos
                        Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory); in 2001, the former inhabitants of the
                        archipelago, evicted 1967 - 1973, were granted UK citizenship and the right of return,
                        followed by Orders in Council in 2004 that banned rehabitation, a High Court ruling
                        reversed the ban, a Court of Appeal refusal to hear the case, and a Law Lords' decision
                        in 2008 denied the right of return; in addition, the UK created the world's largest
                        marine protection area around the Chagos islands prohibiting the extraction of any
                        natural resources therein; UK rejects sovereignty talks requested by Argentina, which
                        still claims the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South
                        Sandwich Islands; territorial claim in Antarctica (British Antarctic Territory) overlaps
                        Argentine claim and partially overlaps Chilean claim; Iceland, the UK, and Ireland
                        dispute Denmark's claim that the Faroe Islands' continental shelf extends beyond 200
