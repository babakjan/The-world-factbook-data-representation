                     <h3>Background</h3>
                     <p><strong></strong> The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons.
                        In succeeding years, other localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation
                        secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848,
                        subsequently modified in 1874 to allow voters to introduce referenda on proposed laws,
                        replaced the confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty
                        and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and the country
                        was not involved in either of the two world wars. The political and economic integration
                        of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and
                        international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbors.
                        However, the country did not officially become a UN member until 2002. Switzerland
                        remains active in many UN and international organizations but retains a strong commitment
                        to neutrality.<br></p>

                        transparent legal system, exceptional infrastructure, efficient capital markets, and
                        low corporate tax rates also make Switzerland one of the world's most competitive

                     <p><strong></strong> The Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's
                        to gain access to the Union’s Single Market and enhance the country’s international
                        competitiveness. Some trade protectionism remains, however, particularly for its small
                        agricultural sector. The fate of the Swiss economy is tightly linked to that of its
                        neighbors in the euro zone, which purchases half of Swiss exports. The global financial
                        crisis of 2008 and resulting economic downturn in 2009 stalled demand for Swiss exports
                        and put Switzerland into a recession. During this period, the Swiss National Bank
                        (SNB) implemented a zero-interest rate policy to boost the economy, as well as to
                        prevent appreciation of the franc, and Switzerland's economy began to recover in 2010.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> The sovereign debt crises unfolding in neighboring euro-zone countries, however, coupled
                        with economic instability in Russia and other Eastern European economies drove up
                        demand for the Swiss franc by investors seeking a safehaven currency. In January 2015,
                        the SNB abandoned the Swiss franc’s peg to the euro, roiling global currency markets
                        and making active SNB intervention a necessary hallmark of present-day Swiss monetary
                        policy. The independent SNB has upheld its zero interest rate policy and conducted
                        major market interventions to prevent further appreciation of the Swiss franc, but
                        parliamentarians have urged it to do more to weaken the currency. The franc's strength
                        has made Swiss exports less competitive and weakened the country's growth outlook;
                        GDP growth fell below 2% per year from 2011 through 2017.<br></p>
                     <p><strong></strong> In recent years, Switzerland has responded to increasing pressure from neighboring
                        countries and trading partners to reform its banking secrecy laws, by agreeing to
                        conform to OECD regulations on administrative assistance in tax matters, including
                        tax evasion. The Swiss Government has also renegotiated its double taxation agreements
                        with numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate OECD standards.<br></p>
